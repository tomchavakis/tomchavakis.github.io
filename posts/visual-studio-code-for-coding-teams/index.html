<h2 id="what-">What ?</h2>
<p>Visual Studio Code is a cross-platform code editor made by Microsoft.
There are more than 30.000 Extensions available to the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/">marketplace</a> of the visual studio code which turns the tool into a powerful, multi-language and multipurpose IDE.</p>
<p>The teams need to have common tools for the day to day work. When you change programs it&rsquo;s easy to get distracted, lose your focus and your purpose. With the following extensions, you can do the biggest part of your work within the visual studio code.</p>
<h2 id="why-">Why ?</h2>
<p>We are humans and we need to communicate. The same basic need for communication exists in software development. Developers want to work together as a team and share their work with others to build products and services.</p>
<p>We know that if we work together we can build high-quality products. We need the tools and the knowledge to do it.</p>
<p>Most of the software development teams are using source control (git) and automation tools (ci/cd). Moreover, teams exploit the Agile Processes and leverage some of the project Tracking Management tools to monitor and track the progress of the deliverables.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is not to promote specific extensions but to continuously answer questions like <strong>&ldquo;How can I automate my work?&quot;</strong> or just <strong>&ldquo;Is there any way to work without switching applications ?&quot;</strong> For me the following extensions automate part of my work but the power of the open-source community is enormous and the current extensions might not be relevant after 1 year, but the way of your thinking probably will be quite the same, so it&rsquo;s important to build patterns and automation for your work.</p>
<h1 id="how-">How ?</h1>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github">GitHub Pull Requests and Issues</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I like this extension because you don&rsquo;t have to switch applications in order to review and manage the Pull Requests and the Issues. Most of the important code review features are possible from within the IDE.
You can</p>
<ul>
<li>see the code differences between the PR&rsquo;s and review them.</li>
<li>check the status and the general comments of each PR.</li>
<li>start working on an issue
What is more exciting is that you can create your own queries in order to filter out the results you want and create a unique list according to your requirements.</li>
</ul>
